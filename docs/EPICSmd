# Project Epics — Rival

This document is the canonical high-level roadmap for the project.
Each epic represents a meaningful user-facing capability and answers one core question.
Epics are intentionally scoped to prevent overbuilding and loss of focus.

This file exists to preserve context across development cycles and conversations.

---

## Epic 0 — Foundation & Trust ✅

### Purpose

Establish a legitimate, secure, and compliant application foundation.

### Core Question

Can users safely authenticate and trust the application with their data?

### Scope

- Application scaffolding
- Environment configuration
- Session management
- Riot Sign-On (RSO) groundwork
- Opt-in concept established (policy + intent)

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No gameplay data ingestion
- No insights
- No public profiles

### Outcome

The application is real, secure, and ready to integrate with Riot services.

---

## Epic 1 — Player Identity & Opt-In ✅

### Purpose

Create a persistent player identity and explicit consent model.

### Core Question

Can the system clearly know _who_ a player is and whether their data may be used?

### Scope

- Project-level user identity
- Linked Riot account (PUUID-based)
- Explicit opt-in persistence
- Opt-out handling
- Identity utilities used across the app

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No insights
- No analysis
- No public-facing stats

### Outcome

The system can confidently say: “This player has opted in, and we may process their data.”

---

## Epic 1.5 — Snapshot Persistence Bridge ✅

### Purpose

Bridge ingestion and analysis without committing to full background processing.

### Core Question

Can we persist computed insight snapshots for fast, stable UI reads?

### Scope

- Minimal match index persistence
- Snapshot-based profile storage
- Deterministic recompute tooling
- Internal-only sync and recompute endpoints
- No background workers

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No full match payload storage
- No live refresh
- No scheduling system

### Outcome

The UI can render real analysis results without recomputation or ingestion depth.

---

## Epic 2 — Analysis Core (Signals & Archetypes) ✅

### Purpose

Transform gameplay summaries into interpretable, trustworthy insights.

### Core Question

Can the system explain _how_ someone plays — not just what happened?

### Scope

- Signal computation (combat impact, opening duels, objective play, etc.)
- Deterministic scoring (0–100)
- Evidence generation
- Confidence modeling
- Archetype scoring (primary + secondary)
- Role fit analysis (declared vs expressed)
- Unorthodox / deviation detection
- Pure, tested analysis primitives

### Design Principles

- Explainability over complexity
- Scores over hard labels
- Confidence required for all interpretations
- Unorthodox ≠ wrong

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No matchmaking
- No ML pipelines
- No social features

### Outcome

The system can explain player behavior in a way that feels fair, grounded, and defensible.

---

## Epic 3 — Player Profile Experience (Insights UI) ✅

### Purpose

Make analysis understandable, trustworthy, and readable at a glance.

### Core Question

Can a user understand their playstyle in under one minute?

### Scope

- Player profile page
- Signals rendering (score, evidence, confidence)
- Archetype summary panel
- Role fit panel
- Unorthodox callout
- Confidence & data window messaging
- Responsive, trust-first UI
- Snapshot-only reads (no compute in UI)

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No match history
- No leaderboards
- No messaging or social features
- No live recompute

### Outcome

A profile users can trust, understand, and confidently share.

---

## Epic 4 — Match History & Match Detail (Defined Before Ingestion) 🧭

### Purpose

Provide transparent access to the matches behind a player’s stats.

### Core Question

Can users explore their match history in a way that validates and complements analysis?

### Scope

- Match history route and page
- Public read-only match list API
- Rendering of available match index data
- Alignment messaging with analysis snapshot window
- Match detail route (stub, structure only)
- Navigation between profile and matches

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No deep per-round breakdowns
- No advanced filters or charts
- No Riot ingestion logic in UI

### Outcome

Users can see _what data_ their insights are based on, building trust and clarity.

---

## Epic 5 — Full Ingestion & Recompute Pipeline 🔒

### Purpose

Ingest real Riot match data and keep player profiles up to date.

### Core Question

Can the system reliably ingest, store, and refresh real gameplay data at scale?

### Scope

- Riot API integration
- Full match payload ingestion
- Background recompute jobs
- Snapshot refresh policies
- Rate-limit handling
- Failure recovery

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No UI redesign
- No new insight types

### Outcome

Rival becomes a live, continuously updating stats platform.

---

## Epic 6 — Advanced Analysis & Refinement (Future)

### Purpose

Refine insight accuracy as edge cases and real data scale appear.

### Core Question

Do insights remain trustworthy across playstyles, roles, and skill levels?

### Scope

- Threshold tuning
- Confidence calibration
- Archetype refinement
- Edge-case detection
- Optional expert feedback loops

### Outcome

Insights remain nuanced and credible as the player base grows.

---

## Epic 7 — Retention & Expansion (Future)

### Purpose

Make Rival a long-term improvement tool.

### Core Question

Why would users keep coming back?

### Scope

- Historical trends
- Improvement tracking
- Periodic summaries
- Multi-game groundwork

### Outcome

Rival becomes part of a player’s long-term improvement loop.

---

## Release Strategy

- Initial release is a **Closed Beta**
- Beta explicitly labeled across the UI
- Disagreement and feedback are expected
- Exit from beta defined by insight trust and accuracy

---

## Guiding Principles

- No epic depends on a future epic to be useful
- Interpretation must always be explainable
- Opt-in and consent are non-negotiable
- UI never invents meaning
- Small, strong releases over speculative scale
