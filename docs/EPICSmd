# Project Epics — EloWars / Rival

This document is the canonical high-level roadmap for the project.
Each epic represents a meaningful user-facing capability and answers one core question.
Epics are intentionally scoped to prevent overbuilding and loss of focus.

This file exists to preserve context across development cycles and conversations.

---

## Epic 0 — Foundation & Trust ✅

### Purpose

Establish a legitimate, secure, and compliant application foundation.

### Core Question

Can users safely authenticate and trust the application with their data?

### Scope

- Application scaffolding
- Environment configuration
- Session management
- Riot Sign-On (RSO) groundwork
- Opt-in concept established (policy + intent)

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No gameplay data ingestion
- No insights
- No public profiles

### Outcome

The application is real, secure, and ready to integrate with Riot services.

---

## Epic 1 — Player Identity & Data Ingestion ✅ (Mocked)

### Purpose

Create a persistent player identity and safely ingest gameplay data.

### Core Question

Can the system reliably build and maintain a player’s historical data over time?

### Scope

- Project-level user account
- Linked Riot account (PUUID-based)
- Explicit opt-in persistence
- Canonical match data model
- Match ingestion pipeline (fixture-based until Riot production access)
- Reprocessing safety (raw data retained)

### Riot Dependency

- Full completion requires Riot production access
- Architecture and logic are designed to work without refactor once access is granted

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No insights
- No interpretation
- No UI polish

### Outcome

The system can confidently say: “This is an accurate record of how this player plays.”

---

## Epic 2 — Insight Engine (Signals & Archetypes) 🔄

### Purpose

Transform raw stats into interpretable, trustworthy insights.

### Core Question

Can the system explain how someone plays — not just what happened?

### Scope

- Signal definitions (e.g. aggression, survivability, team value, consistency)
- Normalization and percentile logic
- Archetype scoring (no hard buckets)
- Role fit analysis (declared vs expressed role)
- Unorthodox / risk–return detection
- Core analysis primitives (pure, tested functions)

### Design Principles

- Explainability over complexity
- Scores over labels
- Confidence indicators required
- Unorthodox ≠ wrong; outcome matters

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No matchmaking
- No social features
- No ML pipelines

### Outcome

The system can explain player behavior in a way that feels fair and accurate.

---

## Epic 3 — Player Profile Experience 🔄

### Purpose

Make insights understandable, trustworthy, and shareable.

### Core Question

Can a user understand themselves in under one minute?

### Scope

- Player profile page
- Identity panel (archetypes + role fit)
- Insight cards (summary, evidence, confidence, action)
- Minimal trend visualizations
- Opt-in and privacy UX
- Beta labeling and disclaimers

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No messaging
- No leaderboards
- No advanced match breakdown UI

### Outcome

A profile users would confidently share with others.

---

## Epic 4 — Playstyle Classification Refinement

### Purpose

Increase accuracy and confidence of classifications through feedback and iteration.

### Core Question

Do classifications remain trustworthy as edge cases appear?

### Scope

- Confidence modeling
- Primary + secondary archetypes
- Expert feedback hooks
- Self-perception vs data comparison
- Disagreement tracking

### Outcome

Classifications feel nuanced, defensible, and respectful of player identity.

---

## Epic 5 — Compatibility Signals

### Purpose

Lay groundwork for teammate discovery without becoming a social app.

### Core Question

Can the system suggest who might play well together?

### Scope

- Compatibility heuristics
- Role overlap detection
- Synergy and conflict signals
- Read-only recommendations

### Explicit Non-Goals

- No chat
- No friend system
- No matchmaking queues

### Outcome

Players gain insight into potential teammate fit.

---

## Epic 6 — Social Discovery (Carefully Scoped)

### Purpose

Enable player connection while keeping the product analytical.

### Core Question

Can players connect without Rival becoming a chat platform?

### Scope

- Opt-in discovery
- Profile sharing
- External contact links (Discord, etc.)

### Outcome

Connections happen off-platform; Rival remains focused.

---

## Epic 7 — Retention & Expansion

### Purpose

Make the product habit-forming and extensible.

### Core Question

Why would users keep coming back?

### Scope

- Weekly summaries
- Improvement tracking
- Light notifications
- Multi-game groundwork

### Outcome

Rival becomes part of a player’s long-term improvement loop.

---

## Release Strategy

- Initial release will be a **Closed Beta**
- Beta explicitly labeled across UI
- Feedback and disagreement are expected and encouraged
- Exit from beta defined by insight accuracy and trust metrics

---

## Guiding Principles

- No epic depends on a future epic to be useful
- Interpretation must always be explainable
- Opt-in and user consent are non-negotiable
- Small, strong releases over speculative scale
