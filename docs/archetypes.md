# Archetype Framework (Epic 2 - Task 2.7)

**Purpose:** Describe observed playstyle tendencies without judging correctness, skill, or optimality.

---

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Archetypes are descriptive**
2. **Archetypes are non-exclusive**
3. **Archetypes are time-bound**
4. **Archetypes are explainable**
5. **Archetypes are NOT judgments**

---

## Structure

Each archetype includes:

- Name
- Applicable cohorts (agent / role / mode)
- Supporting signals
- Confidence (low / medium / high)
- Time window
- Explanation payload

---

## Language Guardrail (Critical)

> **Archetypes describe observed tendencies only.  
> They are NOT evaluations of correctness, intelligence, or optimal play.**

This rule applies to:

- UI labels
- Tooltips
- API outputs
- Documentation

---

## Example Archetype Families

- Aggressive Controller
- High-Variance Playmaker
- Objective Specialist
- Trade-Focused Support
- Stable Anchor

These are labels, not rankings.

---

## Explanation Requirement

Every archetype MUST surface:

- the behaviors observed
- the window analyzed
- the confidence level

No archetype may exist without an explanation.

---

## Prohibited Behavior

Archetypes MUST NOT:

- suggest how a player _should_ play
- imply skill superiority
- override role diversity
